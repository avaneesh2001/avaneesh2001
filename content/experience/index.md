## INTERN 
### TRUMINDS SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

During my internship at Truminds Software Systems, I had the opportunity to work on a project for a client. My role in the project involved software development using Python, specifically focusing on the implementation of Named Entity Recognition for name masking, multiprocessing and multi-threading, and web and social media scraping using Selenium.

Working on this project allowed me to expand my knowledge in software development using Python, specifically in the field of Named Entity Recognition, multiprocessing and multi-threading, and web scraping. I learned how to work with large datasets and implement advanced techniques to extract and process data from different sources. Additionally, I gained experience in working with Selenium, a web scraping tool, which helped me to develop my web scraping skills.

The experience helped me to develop my technical and professional skills and made me more confident in my abilities to work on real-world projects.
