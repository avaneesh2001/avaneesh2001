### LLM driven Unit Testcase Generation

Pioneered the development and implementation of a cutting-edge, codebase-agnostic solution for automated unit test case generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). This innovation significantly enhanced test coverage and streamlined the testing process across diverse large-scale firmware and software codebases, leading to substantial improvements in testing efficiency and reduced manual effort.

➜Achieved significant, quantifiable improvements, including 100% functional coverage and an increase in conditional coverage from 50% to 83%, with a 92% code acceptance rate for generated tests, demonstrating high quality and reliability.

➜ Engineered sophisticated LLM integration to generate high-quality unit test cases, including function mocks and stubs (e.g., KUnit-compatible), by leveraging advanced, dependency resolution for precise and effective test generation across various codebase languages and frameworks.

➜ Developed robust context provision and error handling mechanisms for LLM-based test generation: This included creating an innovative solution to efficiently retrieve function dependencies from massive codebases (1M+ files) and implementing LLM-driven automation for iterative correction of build/runtime errors to significantly improve test reliability.

➜ Designed and optimized an end-to-end iterative test generation and execution workflow: This seamlessly integrated automated test case generation, execution, comprehensive coverage reporting, and targeted generation for uncovered conditions, ultimately collaborating to directly improve overall testing efficiency and code quality.

### O-RAN compliant M-Plane Test Solution.

Pioneered the development and automation of M-Plane test solutions, ensuring rigorous O-RAN specification conformance for a key client, within their cutting-edge Open RAN and 5G initiatives. Key contributions included:

➜ Developed and maintained 47 O-RAN compliant M-Plane test cases, directly contributing to the conformance test suite specifications. This involved:

➜ Developing and evolving Test Automation software within the OpenTAP framework using C#, establishing a robust platform for M-Plane testing and empowering users with custom test plan creation capabilities.

➜ Designed and implemented test cases within the M-Plane toolkit utilizing Python, enhancing testing versatility and scope.

➜ Implemented REST API integration within the Test Automation software to enable remote execution of M-Plane tests, facilitating distributed M-Plane testing, thereby improving test suite scalability.

➜ Streamlined reporting processes by automating TIFG report generation, meticulously capturing comprehensive test details including configuration, status, steps followed, and ODU/ORU responses. This automation significantly reduced manual effort and enabled efficient, automated reporting of test plan results.

➜ Guaranteed strict adherence to critical O-RAN standards, including O-RAN.WG4, Open Front Haul Conformance Test specifications, and M-Plane specifications, thereby ensuring the integrity and compliance of all developed test solutions.

## INTERN

### TRUMINDS SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

<div data-aos="fade-up">
  
During my internship at Truminds Software Systems, I had the opportunity to work on a project for a client. My role in the project involved software development using Python, specifically focusing on the implementation of Named Entity Recognition for name masking, multiprocessing and multi-threading, and web and social media scraping using Selenium.

<div data-aos="fade-up">

Working on this project allowed me to expand my knowledge in software development using Python, specifically in the field of Named Entity Recognition, multiprocessing and multi-threading, and web scraping. I learned how to work with large datasets and implement advanced techniques to extract and process data from different sources. Additionally, I gained experience in working with Selenium, a web scraping tool, which helped me to develop my web scraping skills.
